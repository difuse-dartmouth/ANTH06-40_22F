# ANTH06-40 Module, DIFUSE

Users should look at instructor_directions.docx before moving forward, as that document gives context/setup information for the module. The following links will be used for module data collection.

This file contains the link to the Google Form and Google Sheet related to this module.

Users should perform the following steps to prepare assignment:
1. Using this [link](https://forms.gle/pRJEzgTLem9rg4jr5), create a copy of the Google Form.  
2. Using this [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17CBAwqIPAwoZhLnRJ6HGfusSBF4hffFhF77kSxEBfhI/edit?usp=sharing), create a copy of the Google Sheet that will receive responses from the Google Form.
3. Under the Responses tab in the Google Form, click "Link to Sheets" and select "Select existing spreadsheet". Find the Sheet copied in Step 1, and link it to the new form. Now the pre-formatted Google Sheet will receive the responses from the Google Form. Students will input data into the Form and it will automatically populate the Sheet.

At this time, we are still working on linking the formatted Google Sheet with the new Google Form. Please bear with us as we go through this period of change.
